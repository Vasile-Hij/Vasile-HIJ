&nbsp;
My interest in Computer Science started when I was looking to write scripts to handle databases for work. So I followed courses in a bootcamp at Wantsome IT for Python and Udemy for multiple technologies that this vastly industry offers and now I am trying to break it as a Python Developer. 
Beside backend, I am training myself to grow more and more in frontend, security and networking, so I have to present them in my personal repositories on GitHub.

&nbsp;
Since 2008 I am a cyclist with over 60 competitions which I won, finished honorably, gained experience or simply not finished. There is always a mate to help with a mechanical issue to improve or adjust it, healthy life style among daily temptations or to setup training/race strategy on Strava.
